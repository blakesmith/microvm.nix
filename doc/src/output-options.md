# MicroVM output options

Hypervisor runners are provided in the `config` generated by a
nixosSystem for you to use inside and outside your configuration.

| Option                   | Purpose                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `microvm.runners`        | Attribute set of runner packages per known Hypervisor.    |
| `microvm.declaredRunner` | Runner package selected according to `microvm.hypervisor` |

The `microvm.runners` option provides a runner for each known
Hypervisor regardless of the `microvm.hypervisor` config setting. To
build *my-microvm* for Firecracker for example:

```bash
nix run .#nixosConfigurations.my-microvm.config.microvm.runners.firecracker
```

The `microvm.declaredRunner` selects the hypervisor according to the
configured `microvm.hypervisor`.

```bash
nix run .#nixosConfigurations.my-microvm.config.microvm.declaredRunner
```
